# Josh Lane

**VP of Engineering.** I’m interested in leverage, constraints, and practical problem-solving. Tools matter, but only when they reduce friction instead of creating it. AI is useful; it isn’t magic. I spend most of my time helping teams see the whole problem and spend their energy where it actually moves the needle.

I mostly work in Go, Rust, and whatever scripting language keeps the tooling simple and predictable.

### What I focus on
- Strong constraints as a forcing function for better engineering  
- Tooling that cuts overhead rather than adding ceremony  
- Clear interfaces and small, understandable systems  
- Practical, throughput-focused uses of AI  

### Still hands-on
