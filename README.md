# Hello, I'm Josh Lane! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub page!

## About Me
Also known by my nicknames "lanejoshlane" and "Fast Lane", I'm a Platform Engineering Director with a rich background in tech and leadership. Based in Oakland, CA, I've had an impactful journey through companies like EasyPost, Fastly, Engine Yard.  From Maine, I cut my teeth in the Boston technology scene at EMC, HubSpot and Brontes3D (now part of 3M). I hold a profound interest in building robust technology solutions and developing agile, effective teams.

## What I Do
ðŸš€ **Leadership:** Steering platform engineering at a logistics technology startup, focusing on creating scalable and efficient software architectures.
ðŸ”§ **Technologies I'm Passionate About:**
- Rust: Delving deep into its systems programming capabilities, high performance services and stable tools.
- Ruby: Building APIs and software solutions with an elegant language.
- Lua: Exploring its simplicity and effectiveness in embedded systems, largely through [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim).

ðŸŒ± **Iâ€™m currently learning:**
- Advanced Rust programming techniques and best practices.
- Lua, focusing on its integration with larger systems for better performance.

## Projects
- **[dotfiles](https://github.com/lanej/dotfiles):** My configuration settings for Arch, CentOS, and Darwin. (Frequent updates, stability may vary)
- **[cistern](https://github.com/lanej/cistern):** Ruby API client framework.  An early attempt to create an RPC-like interface for any API that encourages testability.
- **[fog-aws](https://github.com/fog/fog-aws):** AWS module for the 'fog' Ruby gem.  I've largely stepped back from this.
- **[zendesk2](https://github.com/lanej/zendesk2):** A Zendesk API V2 client using Cistern.

## Sponsorship
ðŸŒŸ **[neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim):** I am a proud sponsor of neovim, supporting the advancement of this vital open source project.
